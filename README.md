## CryptoClustering

# Module 11 Challenge
The provided Jupyter notebook script offers a comprehensive analysis pipeline for cryptocurrency market data, incorporating clustering using KMeans and dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Here's a summary of the key steps and functionalities:

# Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Loads cryptocurrency market data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
Normalizes the numeric data to ensure uniform scale across features.

# Elbow Method for Optimal K in KMeans Clustering:
Utilizes the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) for KMeans.
Visualizes the inertia values across different k values to identify the elbow point.

# KMeans Clustering:
Applies KMeans clustering to the normalized data.
Predicts clusters and appends the cluster labels to the DataFrame.

# Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
Reduces the dimensionality of the data using PCA to three principal components.
Conducts KMeans clustering on the PCA-transformed data.

# Visualization:
Generates scatter plots to visualize clusters in both the original feature space and the PCA-reduced space.
Utilizes hvplot for interactive plotting and standard plotting methods for static visualization.
Interpretation:

Analyzes feature weights on principal components to understand their influence.

# This script provides a structured approach to analyze cryptocurrency market data, facilitating cluster identification and exploration of underlying data structure. It can be adapted and extended for various applications in cryptocurrency analysis and market research.
